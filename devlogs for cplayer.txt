devlogs for cplayer

began serilzation implementation

-going well
-can save songs folders and cover arts
-still got some bugs that i am ironing out
-need to remove songs from library when folder is removed, about to implement this now
    - can use the signals and slots approach for this to do what i need

-also just realised that my whole album struct is useless, can simplify my code alot there too lol

so what i need to do

add slots to all the places where songs are stored in lists, these need to be deleted when signal is emitted on folder delete -- DONE
need to delete the album too
    -could check first song i delete for the album and album artist and delete the album
        - assumes that song album is in same location as the song, which it should be
        - will do this for now and see
        - DONE

add support for songs with no metadata, maybe for songs downloaded from the internet


simplify album class to just hold album name and album artists
